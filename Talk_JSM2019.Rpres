The Genome
========================================================

- The genome refers to the entirety of an organisms DNA and genetic information

- It is made up of structures called chromosomes which contain molecules of DNA

- In total, each person has 46 chromosomes with each containing unique genetic information

3D Genomics
========================================================

- Chromosomes are 3D structures with loops

- Areas of the chromosome measured on a linear scale might actually interact to a high degree on a 3D scale due to looping

- Hi-C sequencing is a form of sequencing that allows us to identify these loops

Hi-C Data as a matrix
========================================================

- The genome (chromosome) is binned to equally sized regions

- Data is represented by a symmetric matrix of contacts $C_{ij}$ where entry $ij$ corresponds to the number of times region $i$ comes into contact with region $j$

- Distance is measured in number of basepairs

- A parameter called resolution determines region size

Topologically Associated Domains (TADs)
========================================================

- TADs are regions of the genome that exhibit exceptionally high interconnectedness

- Triangular structures with sharp boundaries

- Boundaries are highly associated with important genomic features

TADs are hierarchical
========================================================

- Organized in a hierarchy

- Characterized by large ‚Äúmeta-TADs‚Äù containing small ‚Äúsub-TADs‚Äù

- Level of hierarchy has an effect on biological relevance

Types of Boundaries and TADs 
========================================================

Why are TADs Important?
========================================================

- Act as walls inhibiting promoter-enhancer interaction and gene expression
- Disruption is potential mechanism for the spread of cancer
- Can be edited using CRISPR
- Associated with the location of CTCF and cohesion
- Highly conserved
- Many possible other functions (Largely unexplored)

Graph Representation of 3D Data
========================================================

- Hi-C data has a natural graph structure

- In mathematical graph theory is defined by vertices V and edges E

- Vertices are points and edges are lines connecting the points together

- Vertices and edges are stored in an adjacency matrix $A_{ij}$ where $ij$ is the number of edges between a given set of vertices $ij$

Traditional Spectral Clustering
========================================================

- Specifically designed to cluster graphs
- Works by projecting the data into a lower dimensional space
- Excels on noisy and non-normally distributed data (Hi-C data)
- Clusters the adjacency matrix $A_{nxn}$

How to perform spectral clustering
========================================================

- Calculate the Laplacian:

$$
D = diag(A\mathbf{1_n})
$$

$$
\bar{L} = D^{-\frac{1}{2}}AD^{-\frac{1}{2}}
$$

- Calculate the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix (graph spectrum):

$$
\bar{L}\mathbf{v} = \lambda\mathbf{v}
$$

- Normalize the eigenvectors and cluster

Spectral clustering with eigenvector gaps
========================================================

- Rows and columns of contact matrices are naturally ordered

- TADs are continuous 

- Ordering allows us to reframe clustering as finding cut points

- We propose a simple, novel, approach to clustering ordered data using gaps between consecutive eigenvectors

Step 1: Plot the non-normalized eigenvectors
========================================================

Step 2: Project on to Unit Circle
========================================================

Step 3: Find the k-largest gaps and partition
========================================================

Silhouette Score
========================================================

- $\textbf{A strong TAD should have a high level of interconnectedness within the TAD and a low-level outside of the TAD}$

- This can be quantified using silhouette score:

$$
\s(i) = \frac{b(i)-a(i)} {max(a(i), b(i))}
$$

Where ùëè(ùëñ)  is the mean distance between point ùëñ and all values in its cluster and ùëé(ùëñ) is the mean distance between point ùëñ and all values outside of its cluster

- Here, we define distance between two points i and j as $\frac{1}{1+C_{ij}}$

Windowed Spectral Clustering
========================================================

- We know the biologically maximum TAD size (2 million bp)

- For a given region we only need to consider points within the maximum TAD size

- We can use a 2 million bp sliding window to perform spectral clustering and aggregate

- Advantages of the sliding window
  - Converts spectral clustering from cubic $(O(n^{3}))$ complexity to linear $(O(n))$
  - Naturally reduces noise from redundant regions

SpectralTAD algorithm
========================================================

1. Cut out a window from the matrix equal to the maximum size of a TAD
2. Find the graph spectrum of the window and calculate eigenvector gap
3. Find n-largest gap values
4. Find the set of clusters that maximize the silhouette score
5. Slide the window to the next group of loci and repeat

Determining a hierarchy of TADs
========================================================

- TADs are hierarchical in nature
- Organized into large meta-TADs with sub-TADs within them
- Need to find sub-TADs within those detected by sliding window
- We use a novel metric called boundary score to achieve this
- Boundary score is just the z-score for each eigenvector gap
- For each initial TAD detected:
  - Calculate the boundary score for each region within the TAD
  - If any distance is greater than 1.96, this is a sub-TAD boundary
  - Repeat for all sub-TADs until no z-score is greater than 1.96
- Alternatively, we can simply repeat silhouette score maximization 

TAD Calling
========================================================

- Refers to methods designed to find TAD boundaries
- Good TAD callers must satisfy five criteria
  - High quality TADs
  - Speed
  - Robustness to sequencing depth
  - Robustness to sparsity
  - Biologically significant boundaries
- We compared:
  - SpectralTAD
  - rGMAP
  - TopDom
  - OnTAD
  - HiCSeg

SpectralTAD is fast
========================================================

Sparsity
========================================================
- One of the main biases in HiC data
- Characterized by random zeros in the contact matrix
- Simulated by replacing a certain percentage of contact matrix with zeros

SpectralTAD is robust to sparsity
========================================================

- The percentages indicate the percentage of the matrix replaced with zeros. 
- Jaccard refers to the similarity between the TADs detected and manually annotated TADs. 
Results are summarized across 25 simulated matrices
- Our method is better than other methods, excluding - HiCSeg, at all levels of sparsity
- Other hierarchical TAD callers (OnTAD and rGMAP) perform relatively poorly

Sequencing depth
========================================================

- Sequencing methods have a set number of possible reads per chromosome 
- Characterized by different magnitudes of total contacts
- Simulated by randomly removing contacts one at a time

SpectralTAD is robust to downsampling
========================================================

- The fraction indicates the proportion of contacts removed. 
- Jaccard refers to the similarity between the TADs detected and manually annotated TADs. 
- Results are summarized across 20 simulated matrices
- Our method outperforms all other methods excluding HiCseg at all levels of downsampling

Expression and depletion based on boundary type
========================================================

- Plot showing peaks within 50kb of boundary types (A & B) and ‚Äìlog10(P-value) for permutation tests aggregated across chromosomes (C & D)
- A & C. Expression plots, B & D . Depletion plots
- We find that in general the expression of features like insulators and CTCF sites are higher in level 3 TADs

SpectralTAD Package
========================================================
- Currently available and fully functional at \href{http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SpectralTAD.html}
- Two main functions: SpectralTAD and SpectralTAD_Par
- First TAD caller designed to accept the three types of contact matrices (n x n, sparse and n x (n+3))
- Produces a simple 3 column bed file output for each hierarchy level

Summary
========================================================
- We have proposed a new approach for TAD detection based on spectral clustering
- We have introduced two novel methods (sliding window and eigenvector gap clustering) for improving clustering on ordered data with size restrictions
- The method was benchmarked against existing methods and has shown a significant improvement
- The method has been released in an R package available on Bioconductor
